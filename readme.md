# Nepali Characters Sign Language Hand Recognition Project

Welcome to the Nepali Characters Sign Language Hand Recognition project! This Github repository contains a Python-based solution for recognizing Nepali sign language characters using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The project utilizes [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) libraries to extract hand landmarks and track hand movements in real-time video feeds. We use this information to preprocess the images and generate a dataset for training the machine learning model. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library is used to build the classification model, which is trained on a labeled dataset of hand images corresponding to different Nepali sign language characters.

## Usage
With this project, users can perform real-time hand gesture recognition for a variety of Nepali characters, enabling communication for those with hearing or speech disabilities. The repository includes detailed documentation on how to set up the project, train the model, and run the sign language recognition system.

## Contributions
We encourage contributions from the open source community to help enhance this project and make it even more accessible and accurate for those who need it. 

Thank you for your interest in the Nepali Characters Sign Language Hand Recognition project!
